      <ul>
        <li>The typical brain is about 2% of a body’s weight but uses 20% of its total energy and oxygen intake.</li>
        <li>Your brain is 73% water. It takes only 2% dehydration to affect your attention, memory and other cognitive skills.</li>
        <li>Ninety minutes of sweating can temporarily shrink the brain as much as one year of aging.</li>
        <li>Your brain weighs about 3 pounds. Of that, the dry weight is 60% fat, making your brain the fattiest organ.</li>
        <li>Twenty-five percent of the body’s cholesterol resides within the brain. Cholesterol is an integral part of every brain cell. Without adequate cholesterol, brain cells die.</li>
        <li>No one knows for sure, but the latest estimate is that our brains contain roughly 86 billion brain cells.</li>
        <li>Each neuron connects with, on average, 40,000 synapses.</li>
        <li>A piece of brain tissue the size of a grain of sand contains 100,000 neurons and 1 billion synapses all communicating with each other.</li>
        <li>All brain cells are not alike. There are as many as 10,000 specific types of neurons in the brain.</li>
        <li>Only 5 minutes without oxygen can cause brain damage.</li>
      </ul>
