        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works. Such research has expanded considerably in recent decades. The "Decade of the Brain", an initiative of the United States Government in the 1990s, is considered to have marked much of this increase in research, and was followed in 2013 by the BRAIN Initiative.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about the structure and function of the human brain comes from a variety of experimental methods. Most information about the cellular components of the brain and how they work comes from studies of animal subjects, using a variety of techniques. Some techniques, however, are used mainly on humans.
