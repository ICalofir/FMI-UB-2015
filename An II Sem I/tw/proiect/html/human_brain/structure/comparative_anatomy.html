        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human brain has many properties that are common to all vertebrate brains, including a basic division into three parts called the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, with interconnected fluid-filled ventricles, and a set of generic vertebrate brain structures including the medulla oblongata and pons of the brainstem, the cerebellum, optic tectum, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, olfactory bulb, and many others.

        As a mammalian brain, the human brain has special features that are common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex and a set of associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The upper surface of the forebrain of other vertebrates is covered in a layer of neural tissue called the pallium. The pallium is a relatively simple three-layered cell structure. The hippocampus and the amygdala originate from the pallium but in mammals they are much more complex.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a primate brain, the human brain has a much larger cerebral cortex, in proportion to body size, than most mammals, and a very highly developed visual system. The shape of the brain within the skull is also altered somewhat as a consequence of the upright position in which primates hold their heads.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hominid brain, the human brain is substantially enlarged even in comparison to the brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size, particularly in the frontal lobes, which are associated with a variety of high-level cognitive functions.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans and other primates have some differences in gene sequence, and genes are differentially expressed in many brain regions. The functional differences between the human brain and the brains of other animals also arise from many gene–environment interactions.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neuroimmune system of the brain is structurally distinct from the peripheral immune system which protects the rest of the body; in particular, the immune system is composed primarily of hematopoietic cells and anatomical barriers, while the neuroimmune system is composed of glia, mast cells, and various brain barriers (e.g., blood–brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier).
