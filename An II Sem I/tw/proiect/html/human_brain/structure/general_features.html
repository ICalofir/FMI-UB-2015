        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adult human brain weighs on average about 1.2–1.4 kg (2.6–3.1 lb), or about 2% of total body weight, with a volume of around 1260 cm3 in men and 1130 cm3 in women, although there is substantial individual variation. Neurological differences between the sexes have not been shown to correlate in any simple way with IQ or other measures of cognitive performance.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human brain is composed of neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels. The number of neurons is estimated at roughly 100 billion. During early pregnancy, neurons have shown to multiply at a rate of 250,000 neurons per minute. The adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these, 16 billion (or 19% of all brain neurons) are located in the cerebral cortex (including subcortical white matter), 69 billion (or 80% of all brain neurons) are in the cerebellum.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cerebral hemispheres (the cerebrum) form the largest part of the human brain and are situated above other brain structures. They are covered with a cortical layer (the cerebral cortex) which has a convoluted topography. Underneath the cerebrum lies the brainstem, resembling a stalk on which the cerebrum is attached. At the rear of the brain, beneath the cerebrum and behind the brainstem, is the cerebellum, a structure with a horizontally furrowed surface, the cerebellar cortex, that makes it look different from any other brain area. The same structures are present in other mammals, although they vary considerably in relative size. As a rule, the smaller the cerebrum, the less convoluted the cortex. The cortex of a rat or mouse is almost perfectly smooth. The cortex of a dolphin or whale, on the other hand, is more convoluted than the cortex of a human.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living brain is very soft, having a gel-like consistency similar to soft tofu. Although referred to as grey matter, the live cortex is pinkish-beige in color and slightly off-white in the interior.
