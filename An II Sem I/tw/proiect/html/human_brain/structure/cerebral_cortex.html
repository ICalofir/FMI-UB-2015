        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dominant feature of the human brain is corticalization, or wrinkling of the cortex. The cerebral cortex in humans is so large that it overshadows every other part of the brain. A few subcortical structures show alterations reflecting this trend. The cerebellum, for example, has a medial zone connected mainly to subcortical motor areas, and a lateral zone connected primarily to the cortex. In humans the lateral zone takes up a much larger fraction of the cerebellum than in most other mammalian species.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corticalization is reflected in function as well as structure. In a rat, surgical removal of the entire cerebral cortex leaves an animal that is still capable of walking around and interacting with the environment. In a human, comparable cerebral cortex damage produces a permanent state of coma. The amount of association cortex, relative to the other two categories of sensory and motor, increases dramatically as one goes from simpler mammals, such as the rat and the cat, to more complex ones, such as the chimpanzee and the human.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gene present in the human genome but not in the chimpanzee (ArhGAP11B) seems to play a major role in corticalization and human encephalisation.[citation needed] The cerebral cortex is essentially a sheet of neural tissue, folded in a way that allows a large surface area to fit within the confines of the skull. When unfolded, each cerebral hemisphere has a total surface area of about 1.3 square feet (0.12 m2).[15] Each cortical ridge is called a gyrus, and each groove or fissure separating one gyrus from another is called a sulcus.
