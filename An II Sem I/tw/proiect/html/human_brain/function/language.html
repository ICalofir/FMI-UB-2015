        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of how language is represented, processed, and acquired by the brain is neurolinguistics, which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience, cognitive linguistics, and psycholinguistics. This field originated from the 19th-century discovery that damage to different parts of the brain appeared to cause different symptoms: physicians noticed that individuals with damage to a portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus now known as Broca's area had difficulty in producing language (aphasia of speech), whereas those with damage to a region in the left superior temporal gyrus, now known as Wernicke's area, had difficulty in understanding it.[24]

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, there has been substantial debate over what linguistic processes these and other parts of the brain subserve.[25] Although Broca's and Wernicke's areas have traditionally been associated with language functions, they may also be involved in certain non-speech functions.[citation needed] There is also debate over whether or not there even is a strong one-to-one relationship between brain regions and language functions that emerges during neocortical development.[26] Research on language has increasingly used more modern methods, including electrophysiology and functional neuroimaging, to examine how language processing occurs.
